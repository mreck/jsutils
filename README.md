# JavaScript Utils

A collection of JavaScript utility functions.
These are the functions that I need all the time.

The library is designed not to have any dependencies.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm i --save @mreck/jsutils
```

```shell
$ yarn add @mreck/jsutils
```

## Why?

Because most of the time I don't need what full JS libraries provide; I only need some of the simpler stuff. 
So here it is.

## TODO

- [ ] Auto generated documentation
- [ ] Browser-ready bundles
- [ ] Unit tests for DOM changes
- [ ] Unit tests for Ajax calls
